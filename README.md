#  📚 Master's Student | 👩‍🔬 Graduate Teaching Assistant | 📊 Scientific Researcher | ✏️ Writer | 🥼 Aspiring Ph.D. Candidate

Hi there! My name is Hannah Hutchins, and I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Health Science: Concentration Biomedical Science at Palm Beach Atlantic University, where I also earned my B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience (Summa Cum Laude) and graduated as the 2024 Oustanding Graduate of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I am currently involved in **teaching**, **laboratory research**, and **journalism**.

🔬 My current research interest focuses on **neurodegeneration** and **toxicology**, particularly using the nematode *C. elegans* as a model organism to explore the effects of glyphosate, the main active ingredient in the popular herbicide Roundup©, on the formation of neurodegenerative disorders. I currently have a literature review published in the *Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science* and am actively applying for a small universitywide grant to continue my toxicology and neurodegeneration research in the laboratory. My ultimate goal is to build the first *C. elegans* neuroscience research laboratory at my university, allowing upcoming undergraduate and master's students to perform research with this fascinating organism and make significant contributions to the field of neuroscience.

🧪 Technical skills include:  
- Microbiology techniques (e.g., bacterial inoculation, media & reagent prep)  
- Research design
- Grant writing  
- Teaching & grading in Biology and Chemistry labs  

✍️ Outside of the laboratory, I’m also a **freelance journalist** and **assistant editor** at *Minding the Campus* and am growing a writing portfolio in both journalism and sci-fi flash fiction.
